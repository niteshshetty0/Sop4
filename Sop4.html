<h4><b>Fire fighter rescue man from building.</b></h4>
REPORTER NAME=<b>"POPATLAL"</b>
DATE="04-12-2020"
<p>FIREFIGHTERS HAVE RESCUED a man by ladder after he appeared to be preparing to jump from a burning high-rise building in 
<b>Los Angeles</b>.<b>“Only the Brave”</b> is a well-made picture depicting the lives of the Granite Mountain Hotshots that 
perished during the 2013 Yarnell Hill Fire.Although I am not a wildland firefighter by trade, I believe this film 
brings home the true nature of the work our brothers and sisters perform in the wildland-urban interface (WUI) 
and forests of America. Although we already know the ending, their journey is worth your time.<p></article>
